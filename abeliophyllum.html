				<b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</b> is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in
				the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species, <b>Abeliophyllum distichum</b> Nakai, endemic to Korea,
				where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having		white, not yellow, flowers.</br>
				</br>
				It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1-2 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple, 6-10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide,	pubescent both above and below. The flowers are pro-duced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed	corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2-3 cm di-
				ameter.<br>
				<br>
				It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.<br>
